# Introduction
This is a TFT set 12 team planner that uses genetic algorithms to automatically generate team comps.

Basically, team comps are scored and sorted based on the number of breakpoints they match.

The app supports tacticians crown, bonus traits from spatulas/augments, Built Different II, and setting core units.
